The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for object-oriented software design intended to make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Here's a brief summary of each principle:

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
- **Purpose**: This principle helps in reducing the complexity of a class by ensuring it handles a single functionality. It leads to easier maintenance and a lower chance of bugs when changes are made.

### 2. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **Purpose**: This principle encourages the design of components that never change when new functionality is added, thus making a system more robust, scalable, and resilient to changes.

### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Purpose**: LSP ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass. The principle is crucial for achieving substitutability of classes which leads to more flexible and reusable code.

### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Definition**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **Purpose**: ISP suggests splitting large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that implementing classes only need to be concerned with the methods that are relevant to them. This leads to a cleaner, decoupled design.

### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- **Purpose**: DIP aims to reduce the coupling between high-level modules and low-level modules by introducing an abstraction layer between them. This helps in making the system easier to refactor, scale, and maintain.

Together, these principles guide the development of software systems that are easier to manage, scale, and understand, enabling developers to create better software architecture.
